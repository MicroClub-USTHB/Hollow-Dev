# Hollow Dev Hackathon

### Rules

- You can use any tech stack that you prefer.
- The response must be in JSON format.
- You need to store data for each challenge in a database.
- The project should have a good folder structure (e.g., models, routes, middlewares).
- the response object must have a uniform structure for all endpoints.
- Environment variables should be stored in a `.env` file.
- For difficult challenges, you need to host your API (You can use any hosting service).
- Each challenge must be documented.
- For each challenge, the submission must include a GitHub link (We track commits ðŸ‘€).
- When a challenge demands a frontend, we do not judge design; basic HTML is enough.

## Judging Criteria

### Projects will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Innovation:** Creativity and originality of the solution.
- **Functionality:** How well the project works and fulfills the requirements.
- **Usability:** User experience and ease of use.
